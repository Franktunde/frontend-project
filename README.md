LEARNING DIARY, <SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SKILLS:FRONTEND 2022-23> MODULE



 
LEARNING DIARY

EXAMPLE STYLE 1
10.9.2018

I checked the general information and understood the main focus of the course, which is to find my passion as a software developer and create a unique project to represent my skills. I chose frontend module because it was the most interesting project offered. I’ve also tried to set up my environment, but I could not decide which code editor I would like to use.  I learned to set up a git repository and did my first commit, everything went smoothly after I clicked the banner to watch intro to GIT.  

11.9.2018

I have chosen VS Code as my code editor for this course, I learned how to set up addons by googling how to do it. I searched the web for best addons and chose the best addons that I think fits me best.  I started to watch the first part of the example project to understand the technologies better.

I did my second commit but somehow it did not go as I planned. I went to stackoverflow and found quite many threads about version control problems. I was able to figure out what was the problem and continued to watch the first part till the end.
